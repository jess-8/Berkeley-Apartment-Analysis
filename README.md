## General Info
To get a general idea of the apartment prices in Berkeley (where many students are located and thus would benefit from this project), I built a webscraper to scrape the first three pages of Apartments.com in regards to apartments located in Berkeley. I then stored the data in a mySQL database, where I cleaned and filtered the data, before transferring to an Excel File. I created the visualizations of this data using a Story in Tableau.

## Technologies
